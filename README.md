## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm **Jaydipsinh Solanki**

Engineer who learns by building. Changed my focus after 2 years of college to work on real projects. Join **Edutor App** (350K+ users), a platform for teachers and students, aiming to become the *Amazon of Education*. Developed government chatbots and citizen portals, with a notable project being *Samadhan AI* for the *Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs*. Passionate about solving real-world problems with techâ€”**backend**, **AI**, and **full-stack dev**. Always experimenting with new ideas.

If youâ€™re working on something that actually helps people, letâ€™s team up and make it happen! ðŸ’¡ðŸš€
